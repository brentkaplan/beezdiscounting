An R package containing commonly used functions for analyzing behavioral economic discounting data.

The package supports scoring of the 27-Item Monetary Choice Questionnaire (see 
[Kaplan et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40614-016-0070-9)) and scoring of the 
minute discounting task (see [Koffarnus & Bickel, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0035973))
using the Qualtrics 5-trial discounting template (see the 
[Qualtrics Minute Discounting User Guide](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.26495.79527)), 
which is also available as a .qsf file in this package.

# Using the Package {#usingpackage}

## 27-item Monetary Choice Questionnaire Scoring Overview

### Example Dataset {#exdata}

An example dataset of responses on the 27-Item Monetary Choice Questionnaire 
is provided. This object is called `mcq27` and is located within 
the `beezdiscounting` package. These data are the example data used in the 
paper by 
[Kaplan et al, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6701266/). 
Note the format of the data, which is called "long format". Long format data 
are data structured such that repeated observations are stacked in multiple 
rows, rather than across columns.

```{r example-data-set, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(mcq27[c(1:7, 28:34), ])
```

The first column contains the subject id. The second column contains 
the question id. The third column contains the response (0 for smaller sooner, 
1 for larger later) 

### Converting from Wide to Long and Vice Versa

`beezdiscounting` includes several helper functions to reshape data. 

##### `long_to_wide_mcq()`

Long format data are widened such that subject id is the first column
and each subsequent column contains the response associated with the question
(specified as column names). 

```{r long-to-wide-mcq}
wide <- long_to_wide_mcq(generate_data_mcq(2))

knitr::kable(wide[, c(1:5, 24:28)], caption = "Wide Format Data")
```

##### `wide_to_long_mcq()`

Wide data (see example of wide data above) are made long such that subject id
is in the first column, question id (inferred from the column names from the 
wide format dataframe) is the second column, and the response is the third 
column. 

```{r wide-to-long-mcq, results='asis'}
long <- wide_to_long_mcq(wide, items = 27)

knitr::kable(long[c(1:5, 28:32), ], caption = "Long Format Data")
```

##### `wide_to_long_mcq_excel()`

A different 'type' of wide data is that used in the 27-Item Monetary Choice
Questionnaire Automated Excel Scorer 
([Kaplan et al, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6701266/)).
In this format, the first column is the question id and each subsequent column
represents a subject (as the column name) and the response in rows (see the
example below). This function takes the data from that format and converts
it to the format needed for `beezdiscounting` functions.

```{r wide-excel-data, echo=FALSE}
wide_excel <- structure(list(questionid = 1:27, `1` = c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 
1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 
1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L), `2` = c(1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 
0L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 
1L, 1L, 1L, 1L)), row.names = c(NA, -27L), class = c("tbl_df", 
"tbl", "data.frame"))
```

```{r wide-excel, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(wide_excel[c(1:5, 22:27), ], 
             caption = "Format Expected in the 27-Item MCQ Excel Scorer")

long_excel <- wide_to_long_mcq_excel(wide_excel)

knitr::kable(long_excel[c(1:5, 28:32), ], caption = "Long Format")
```

##### `long_to_wide_mcq_excel()`

Data can be manipulated from long form into a form used by the 27-Item
Monetary Choice Questionnaire Automated Excel Scorer.

```{r long-to-wide-excel, results='asis'}
wide_excel <- long_to_wide_mcq_excel(long_excel)

knitr::kable(wide_excel[c(1:5, 22:27), ], 
             caption = "Format Expected in the 27-Item MCQ Excel Scorer")

```



### Generate Fake MCQ Data

Generate data specifying reproducibility and proportion of `NA` responses.

```{r gen-fake-nomissing}
## fake data with no missing values
fake_data_no_missing <- generate_data_mcq(n_ids = 2, n_items = 27, 
                                          seed = 1234, prop_na = 0)
knitr::kable(fake_data_no_missing, caption = "Fake Data - No Missings")
```

```{r gen-fake-missing}
## fake data with missing values
fake_data_missing <- generate_data_mcq(n_ids = 2, n_items = 27, 
                                          seed = 1234, prop_na = .1)
knitr::kable(fake_data_missing, caption = "Fake Data - Missings")
```


### Score 27-item MCQ

MCQ data can be scored regularly and can also impute using various methods
specified by [Yeh et al, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292258)

#### Normal (no imputation)

##### No missing data
```{r score-impute-none-1}
## normal scoring of data with no missing values
tbl1 <- score_mcq27(fake_data_no_missing)
```

```{r score-impute-none-1-output, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tbl1[, c(1:6)], caption = "k Values")
knitr::kable(tbl1[, c(1, 7:11)], caption = "Consistency Scores")
knitr::kable(tbl1[, c(1, 12:16)], caption = "Proportions")
```

##### Missing data
```{r score-impute-none-2}
## normal scoring of data with missings with no imputation
tbl2 <- score_mcq27(fake_data_missing)
```

```{r score-impute-none-2-output, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tbl2[, c(1:6)], caption = "k Values")
knitr::kable(tbl2[, c(1, 7:11)], caption = "Consistency Scores")
knitr::kable(tbl2[, c(1, 12:16)], caption = "Proportions")
```


#### GGM imputation

This approach (Group Geometric Mean) "...calculates the composite k when at 
least one of the three amount set ks is fully available" 
([Yeh et al, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292258))

```{r score-impute-ggm}
tbl3 <- score_mcq27(fake_data_missing, impute_method = "GGM")
```

```{r score-impute-ggm-output, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tbl3[, c(1:6)], caption = "k Values")
knitr::kable(tbl3[, c(1, 7:11)], caption = "Consistency Scores")
knitr::kable(tbl3[, c(1, 12:16)], caption = "Proportions")
```

#### INN imputation (no random component)

This approach (Item Nearest Neighbor) "...replaces the missing value with the 
congruent non-missing responses to the items corresponding to the same k value"
([Yeh et al, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292258))

```{r score-impute-inn-norandom}
tbl4 <- score_mcq27(fake_data_missing, impute_method = "INN")
```

```{r score-impute-inn-norandom-output, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tbl4[, c(1:6)], caption = "k Values")
knitr::kable(tbl4[, c(1, 7:11)], caption = "Consistency Scores")
knitr::kable(tbl4[, c(1, 12:16)], caption = "Proportions")
```

#### INN imputation (with random component)

This approach (Item Nearest Neighbor with Random) "... is identical to 
[INN no random component], except that when a missing response cannot be 
resolved, this datum will be randomly replaced with 0 or 1, 
corresponding to choosing immediate or delayed rewards, respectively" 
([Yeh et al, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292258))

```{r score-impute-inn-random}
tbl5 <- score_mcq27(fake_data_missing, impute_method = "INN",
                    random = TRUE)
```

```{r score-impute-inn-random-output, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tbl5[, c(1:6)], caption = "k Values")
knitr::kable(tbl5[, c(1, 7:11)], caption = "Consistency Scores")
knitr::kable(tbl5[, c(1, 12:16)], caption = "Proportions")
```

##### Return a list
You can also return a list when INN imputation with random is specified. This
is helpful to see what values replaced the missings (`NA`s) in the original 
dataset.

```{r score-impute-inn-random-list}
lst <- score_mcq27(fake_data_missing, impute_method = "INN",
                    random = TRUE, return_data = TRUE)
```

The scoring summary metric dataframe as before (access via `...$results`):

```{r score-impute-inn-random-list-output, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(lst$results[, c(1:6)], caption = "k Values")
knitr::kable(lst$results[, c(1, 7:11)], caption = "Consistency Scores")
knitr::kable(lst$results[, c(1, 12:16)], caption = "Proportions")
```

The original data and the new responses imputed (access via `...$data`):

```{r score-impute-inn-random-list-output-2, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(lst$data, caption = "Original Data and Imputed Data")
```

## Scoring the Minute Discounting Tasks

### 5.5 Trial Delay Discounting Task
```{r dd, results = 'asis'}
dd_out <- calc_dd(five.fivetrial_dd)

knitr::kable(dd_out, caption = "Scoring Summary of the 5.5 Trial Delay Discounting Task")
```

### 5.5 Trial Probability Discounting Task
```{r pd, results = 'asis'}
pd_out <- calc_pd(five.fivetrial_pd)

knitr::kable(pd_out, caption = "Scoring Summary of the 5.5 Trial Probability Discounting Task")
```
