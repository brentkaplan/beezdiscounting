# Behavioral Economic (be) Easy (ez) Discounting
An R package containing commonly used functions for analyzing behavioral economic discounting data.

The package supports scoring of the 27-Item Monetary Choice Questionnaire (see Kaplan et al., 2016; 
doi:[10.1007/s40614-016-0070-9](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40614-016-0070-9)) and scoring of the 
minute discounting task (see Koffarnus & Bickel, 2014; doi:[10.1037/a0035973](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0035973))
using the Qualtrics 5-trial discounting template (see the Qualtrics Minute Discounting User Guide; 
doi:[10.13140/RG.2.2.26495.79527](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.26495.79527)), which is also available 
as a .qsf file in this package.
