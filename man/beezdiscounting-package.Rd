\title{beezdiscounting: Behavioral Economic Easy Discounting}
\description{
Facilitates some of the analyses performed in studies of behavioral economic discounting. The package supports scoring of the 27-Item Monetary Choice Questionnaire (see Kaplan et al., 2016; \doi{10.1007/s40614-016-0070-9}), calculating k values (Mazur's simple hyperbolic and exponential) using nonlinear regression, calculating various Area Under the Curve (AUC) measures, plotting regression curves for both fit-to-group and two-stage approaches, checking for unsystematic discounting (Johnson & Bickel, 2008; \doi{10.1037/1064-1297.16.3.264}) and scoring of the minute discounting task (see Koffarnus & Bickel, 2014; \doi{10.1037/a0035973}) using the Qualtrics 5-trial discounting template (see the Qualtrics Minute Discounting User Guide; \doi{10.13140/RG.2.2.26495.79527}), which is also available as a .qsf file in this package.
